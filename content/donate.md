## Money

**Money burning a hole through your pocket?** Chimera is always happy to receive cash donations!

Your cash donation will go to helping us pay for rent and utilities, purchase equipment and supplies and put on events, meetups and classes!


## Volunteering

**Don't have things or money to donate but want to help?** We're always looking for people to help us clean and move things, produce events and 

Have a particular skill? Then you might want to consider [teaching at Chimera]()


## Tax Receipt

Since we're a 501\(c\)3 organization, we can offer tax receipts for donations we accept and that are valued. 

*If you want a tax receipt for your donation, please let us know otherwise no receipt will be issued!*
